All names of things that are defined are identifiers. An identifier consists of 255 significant characters letters, digits and the underscore character, from which the first must be an alphanumeric character, or an underscore. As you may expect, constants must be definable at compile-time. However, Pascal was also designed so that it could be compiled in 1 pass from top to bottom the reason being to make compiling fast and simple.
